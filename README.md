# Task Manager
Hello, I'm Brandon, a high school computer programmer/coder, and I made a terminal-based Task Manager using Java (within a week of learning it :D)!

## Usage
You can add tasks, complete tasks, assign responsibilities to people for those tasks, delete tasks, and inspect tasks
Unfortunately, I haven't created a good/user-friendly UI for the common people to be able to access it easily (it IS terminal-based), but if you have VS Code, feel free to download the code and try it out for yourself! :)
